# Disclaimer:

This repo only contains the changes I made to the [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim), to configure it to my liking.

If for some reason you want my config:
 - Follow their guide to install Neovim and all dependences (like fd, ripgrep...)
 - Place the kickstart configuration in the right place.
 - Then paste the files you find in `nvimconfig/` in the directory you made for kickstart. That should work.

# > [!WARNING]
> My installation was done on Windows, I use it with Git Bash. Some little things don't work, like using the commands inside nvim directle with `:!`. But in general, works pretty well.
